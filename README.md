DomainrSharp
============

C# Wrapper for Domai.nr. This library is now a portable class library and means it can be used with .NET 4 (4.0.3), Silverlight 4 and above, Windows phone 7.5 and above and Windows Store apps.

## Licence ##
My own licence for this is use it as much as you want, do what you want. However, at present, it uses the HttpClient package for portable class libraries, which doesn't yet have a Go Live licence, so really, no one can use it in a production app. Please bear this in mind until Microsoft say it's ok. If you use the nuget package version 1.1 this doesn't have that problem.
